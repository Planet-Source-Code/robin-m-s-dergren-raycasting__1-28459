## RayCasting


</div>

### Description

NEW UPDATE HERE! CHECK README.TXT FOR DETAILED INFO!

This is a simple example of how to "ray-cast"!

It's a very simple techinc, when you get to understand it.

This is how good old DOOM and WOLFENSTEIN 3D is made, they

also used ray-casting/ray-tracing. So they are not really

3D-games, just simulated 3D!!

You don't have to have a very good computer to run this.

And NO 3d-card is needed, altough it might make it run faster!

I've seen so many examples of raycasting, but I didn't find

anyone that runs fast on my computer, at least not made in VB!

So I decided I'd make one, that isn't really that complex just to

show how it's done!! :o)
