RayCasting v.0.3.12

This is a simple example of how to "ray-cast"!
It's a very simple techinc, when you get to understand it.
This is how good old DOOM and WOLFENSTEIN 3D is made, they
also used ray-casting/ray-tracing. So they are not really
3D-games, just simulated 3D!!

You don't have to have a very good computer to run this.
And NO 3d-card is needed, altough it might make it run faster!

I've seen so many examples of raycasting, but I didn't find
anyone that runs fast on my computer, at least not made in VB!
So I decided I'd make one, that isn't really that complex just to
show how it's done!! :o)

Remember this, I'm only 16 yeats old, and I started my programming-
"career" when I was about 13. So i don't have that much
experience, so it's really not that hard to understand! I've even
commented every single line!! So you should be able to follow
through my code and know what happens, but maybe not understand why! ;)

I wanna thank Simon Price, SimonPrice@VBgames.co.uk, 
for his work in "VB DOOM" (found on planetsourcecode.com) 
that got me started in raycasting. And I also wanna thank
Kasper Fauerby, tm@image.dk, for his PASCAL-raycasting
tutorial (found on programmersheaven.com), even though 
I didn't understand much of the PASCAL-code!

You may use, modify and distribute this code/application as you wish,
as long as you give me some credit!!
